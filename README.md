# Wheel Tweak Remover

This tiny clientside coremod patches out the Wheel Tweak (item scrolling) functionality from NotEnoughItems.

### Why?
I don't like NEI's item scrolling: it's buggy and laggy. I'd rather use the Wheel Tweak in Mouse Tweaks, but there's no way of disabling the one in NEI, and an issue about adding a configuration option was ignored.

### Building
`gradlew setupCIWorkspace build`
